#  Titanic Survival Prediction using Machine Learning

This project builds a machine learning classification model to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on features such as Age, Sex, Fare, and Passenger Class.

## 📌 Project Overview

- Dataset: Titanic dataset (from Kaggle)
- Goal: Predict the Survived column (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
- Algorithm Used: Random Forest Classifier
- Key Steps:
  - Data cleaning and preprocessing
  - Handling missing values
  - Encoding categorical variables
  - Feature selection using Chi-Square test
  - Train-test split and model training
  - Evaluation using accuracy and classification report

## 🛠️ Libraries Used

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

## 💡 How to Run

1. Clone the repository  
2. Install required packages:
  
  
  ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook or script.

## 📊 Output

- Accuracy Score
- Classification Report
- Confusion Matrix (optional)
